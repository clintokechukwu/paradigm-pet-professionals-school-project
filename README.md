## Paradigm Pet Professionals Website Redesign

This project is a full redesign of the Paradigm Pet Professionals website aimed at improving user experience, accessibility, and business conversion goals.

This project involved redesigning the Paradigm Pet Professionals website based on a provided UI design specification and a set of stakeholder and user persona requirements. The objective was to improve the site’s information architecture, usability, accessibility, and overall visual design while supporting business goals such as increasing website traffic and generating new consultation bookings. The redesign required analyzing existing content, identifying usability issues, and creating a new site structure that clearly serves multiple user groups, including dog owners, cat owners, and new pet owners. The final deliverables included a sitemap, wireframes, and an interactive prototype that demonstrates intuitive navigation, responsive layout, and conversion-focused features such as a consultation request form and strong call-to-action elements.

Key features include:
- Dedicated pet care pages for dogs, cats, and birds
- Evidence-based pet care content tailored to each user persona
- A consultation request form that captures required user and pet information
- Conversion-focused call-to-action sections to increase bookings
- Accessible color contrast, typography, and alt text for usability

This project helped build my skills in front-end development (HTML/CSS) and UI/UX design, including information architecture, wireframing, and building user-centered interfaces.
